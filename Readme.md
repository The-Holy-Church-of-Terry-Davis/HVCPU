# Holy Virtual CPU Runtime/Driver

This project is mainly for my C# OS that I'm working on,
however, it made sense to publish the source code as a
separate repository due to the fact that it was easily
portable to C#'s standard libraries.

This source code can be built and ran as a runtime service
for HVCPU binaries, or, it can be used as a library to read,
and execute them from within your own applications.
